-- Verify the data
SELECT * FROM Superheroes;


To create another data sample that can be joined with the superhero data, you can generate a related dataset. 
Let's create a "Superhero Affiliation" dataset, which contains information about which superhero is affiliated with which superhero group or organization. 
Here's the schema and some sample data:

-- Create a table for the superhero affiliations
CREATE TABLE SuperheroAffiliations (
    AffiliationID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SuperheroID INT,
    AffiliationName NVARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data for affiliations
INSERT INTO SuperheroAffiliations (AffiliationID, SuperheroID, AffiliationName)
VALUES
    (1, 1, 'Justice League'),
    (2, 1, 'The Bat Family'),
    (3, 2, 'Justice League'),
    (4, 2, 'Daily Planet'),
    (5, 3, 'Justice League'),
    (6, 3, 'Themyscira'),
    (7, 4, 'The Avengers'),
    (8, 5, 'The Avengers'),
    (9, 6, 'Justice League'),
    (10, 6, 'Flash Family');

Certainly, We'll provide some questions to perform different-2 operations.

Question 1- Retrieve the total number of superheroes in the database.
